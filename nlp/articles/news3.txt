Durban - Four people, of which three were school pupils, were killed when they were hit by an out-of control minibus taxi on Prince Mcwayizeni Drive near the Isipingo Reunion Station on Wednesday morning.

The children had been waiting at the roadside while on their way to school.

Rescuecare spokesperson Garrith Jamieson said that seven other people were injured in the accident, which saw the fully laden minibus leave the road and plough into the unsuspecting pedestrians.

Jamieson described the accident as “horrific” and said that medics had raced to the scene shortly after 06:00.

“Paramedics arrived on the scene to find absolute carnage. A taxi had crashed through a sidewalk wall, knocking over multiple people and then crashing into another vehicle.”

He said that with the overwhelming number of dead and injured on the scene, more help had to be called in.

“More ambulances, SAPS Search and Rescue and Durban Fire Department were called to assist with the multiple casualty incident.

“Paramedics found that four people had sustained fatal injuries including three children. There was nothing more paramedics could do and they were declared deceased on the scene,” he said.

“A further seven people, both pedestrians and passengers from the minibus, had been seriously injured and were stabilised by Rescue Care’s Advanced Life Support Paramedic before being rushed to various Durban Hospitals for the further care that they required,” Jamieson added.

He said that cause of the crash and the events leading up to it would be investigated by the police’s Collision Unit.
