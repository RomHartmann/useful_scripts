"The suspects were driving a white Audi. There were no AK47s, just one pistol used by the suspect who approached the drivers side.

"I can confirm that a laptop, 6 iPhones, and US dollars, all to the value of R170 000, were stolen from the vehicle, along with the car keys. The victim was in a taxi and had come from the airport, but it is unclear whether he was followed," he added.
