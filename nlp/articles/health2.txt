According to UK charity Hearing Link a good place to start is by working on the following skills: 

• Training your eyes to stay focused on the tongue, lips and mouth of the person who is speaking.
• Learning how to notice changes in the facial expressions made by the person speaking.
• Being acutely aware of body language and what it means. For example: an excited and enthusiastic person might have open stance and make more energized movements. 
• If you are experiencing hearing loss using residual hearing can help you when starting off lip reading.
• Anticipation of what might be said next based on what has been said before especially because lots of words look similar on the mouth but might not fit in the situation. There is a video below that gives a good example of this.

5 tips on how to start lip reading :

Not everyone is able to lip read but it’s possible to challenge yourself and see how you do with these tips from Lipreading.org to start you off on the right path -  

• Body talk: Position yourself in a way that gives you the best chance to see the person who is speaking’s face and body language. No more than about six feet apart. It could also be beneficial to mention that you are lip reading and remind them not to turn their face away. 

• Cut yourself some slack:  Don’t put too much pressure on yourself to catch every word the first few times. Yes, not everyone can lip read, but getting stressed out and frustrated can stop you from reaching your peak potential as well. Try to stay calm and use the subject matter and body language to help you.

• Let the rhythm guide you: Most people have their own cadence when speaking and this can help you to read their lips by picking up rhythmic pauses or when emphasize is placed on certain words.

• Practice and determination can be the key to success : Lip reading is not something that you can pick up overnight but rather a skill that takes plenty of practice so that habits can form and become second nature. The more you do it the better that you will be.
