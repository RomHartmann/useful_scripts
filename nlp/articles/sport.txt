Cape Town - Former Proteas batsman Neil McKenzie has reportedly agreed to become Cricket South Africaâ€™s new batting consultant.

McKenzie, who last week retired from cricket after the Highveld Lions agreed to release him from his contract, is currently playing in the Masters Champions League in Dubai.

The 40-year-old told the Sunday Times that CSA wants him to work and travel with the national team when needed, including a trip to the ICC World T20 in March.

Coach Russell Domingo admitted after the Test series against England that they had approached several candidates for the role of batting coach over the last year, but that they were turned down.

Graeme Smith helped out prior to the Cape Town Test, while Lance Klusener was asked to help with the tail-enders for the Durban Test,

CSA told Netwerk24 on Sunday that nothing was confirmed and that negotiations with McKenzie will start upon his return from the UAE.
