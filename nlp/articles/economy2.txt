Johannesburg - The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) has asked the countryâ€™s High Court to declare two contracts awarded to a security company invalid two months after asking for the cancellation of an agreement to supply locomotives.

Prasa wants two contracts warded to Siyangena Technologies worth about R4bn invalid because the company was given an advantage through "bid-rigging" and the contracts were coupled with alleged "corrupt activities", according to an affidavit by chairperson Popo Molefe filed with a motion on February 2 at the High Court in Pretoria.

The contracts were awarded to Siyangena for the supply and installation of integrated security access management systems at Prasa stations, according to an emailed statement from the rail company and a copy of the court filing. The tenders were designed so that only Siyangena could supply the equipment, Prasa said.

Public Protector, Thuli Madonsela, said in a report published in August that an investigation into Prasa covering the period from about 2008 to 2013 found the company had a culture of "systemic failure" to comply with its own supply-chain policy.
